# Chatty the Chatbot - First Semester Programming Fundamentals Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Chatty the Chatbot! This project, developed as part of the first-semester Programming Fundamentals course, serves as an engaging and interactive chatbot programmed in C. Chatty offers conversation, introduces itself, and provides various functionalities, employing fundamental programming concepts.

## Basic PF Concepts Used
1. **File Handling:** Chatty utilizes file handling to log conversations and user interactions in a text file (`chatbot.txt`). This demonstrates basic file input/output operations.

2. **Conditional Statements:** The project extensively employs conditional statements for decision-making. For instance, determining whether to continue the conversation, exit the program, or proceed to specific functionalities.

3. **Loops:** Chatty uses loops for repetitive tasks. For example, the program loops to ask users about stress, boredom, and offers suggestions based on their responses.

4. **Functions:** The code is structured with functions such as `intro()`, `work()`, `games()`, `comppick()`, and `rockpaperscissor()` for better organization and reusability.

5. **Arrays and Strings:** Arrays and strings are used for storing and manipulating data. The user's name, responses, and game-related answers are stored in arrays.

6. **User Input and Output:** The program uses `printf` and `scanf` for user prompts and input, ensuring interaction with the user.

7. **Randomization:** Chatty incorporates randomization to add an element of surprise, such as in the "Guess the Number" game.

8. **Switch Statements:** Switch statements are employed for menu-driven functionalities, allowing users to choose between options for introduction, work, or exiting.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Follow Chatty's prompts to continue the conversation or exit.
3. Choose to get a small introduction or proceed to work.
4. Interact with Chatty, answer questions, and explore functionalities.

## Games
- **Knowledge is Power:** Answer trivia questions.
- **404 Error:** Answer questions related to computer science.
- **Love at First Bite:** Answer food-related riddles.
- **Rock Paper Scissors:** Play the classic game against the computer.
- **Guess the Number:** Guess the randomly generated number.
